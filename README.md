<h1>Zeekit Frontend Challenge</h1>

# Prueba técnica de Zeekit con React y Tailwindcss

<h2>Gameplay and rules:</h2>

The goal of the game is to guess a TV show´s name

The player will see a placeholder for a TV name with some missing letter. The player should guess and fill
in the TV show´s name.

If the player guesses successfully a tv show name, it gets a point and moves forward to guess another tv show name.

The player would be able to use a hint feature in case it´s stuck with a specific TV show.

The player has a total of 3 life points. For each wrong guess, it loses a point. If the player lost all 3 points the game is over and can be started again.
